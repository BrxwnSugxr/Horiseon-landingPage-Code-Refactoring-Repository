# Horiseon Refactoring Landing Page

The project involves refactoring an existing website for a marketing agency to enhance web accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). The goal is to improve the codebase by making it more accessible for users with disabilities, optimizing it for better search engine rankings, and ensuring efficient and well-documented CSS. The emphasis is on exceeding expectations, leaving the code cleaner than before, and implementing changes that contribute to the long-term sustainability of the project. The task includes specific criteria such as improving accessibility, consolidating CSS, checking link functionality, and providing thorough documentation through comments.
